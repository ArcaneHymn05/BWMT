                            In the third week, I learned about Javascript, so this time the website ROCK PAPER SCISSORS(RPS) consisted of HTML5,CSS3 and Javascript.

                            I learned how to do an interactive square. When clicking on it , the textbox would change. The use of HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript were used.

                            This project took around 2weeks to complete. It uses Data processing and a bit of Design methodology. The DOM was also learned. I also learaned about shell which is a code ready to use.
                            The to do project had 4 buttons, Add task which consisted of adding a task, All button which list all task, Active button which shows all active task and Completed button which shows all completed tasks.

                    Designing and developing the website were not much an issue as I had self-learn HTML, CSS and Javascript from another module. But if i had to name my main issue it was designing the website as it was very frustrating to create a visually appealing webpage. It involed many trial and error like experimenting with different colors, fonts, layout and images to be able to achieve what would feel the best to my viewers. Despite that I still feel that I like might not please others, I had to view many websites as inspirations. Furthermore I had to inspire myself from YouTube too. I targetted moslty #id instead of class so as not to change all at once. To be honest I still do not understand JavaScript and CSS fully, but by trial and error I am able to sort them out.
