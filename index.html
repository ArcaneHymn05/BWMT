                        <p>
                            In the first week, I learned about HTML5 and designed an HTML website using basic knowledge. The website had an image and anchors. It had no CSS. I also learned about copyright.

                        <p>
                            For the second week, we made changes to the first project. That includes changing the background colour to blue.

                        <h2>ROCK PAPER SCISSORS</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the third week, I learned about Javascript, so this time, the website ROCK PAPER SCISSORS(RPS) consisted of HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.

                            I learned how to do an interactive square. When clicking on it, the textbox would change. The use of HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript were used.

                        <p>
                            This project took around 2weeks to complete. It uses Data processing and a bit of Design methodology. The DOM was also learned. I also learned about the shell, a code ready to use. The to-do project had four buttons; add task, which consisted of adding a task. All buttons list all tasks, the Active button, which shows all active tasks and the Completed button, which shows all completed tasks.

                    Designing and developing the website was relatively easy as I had self-learn HTML, CSS and Javascript from another module. But if I had to name my main issue, it was designing the website, as creating a visually appealing webpage was very frustrating. It involved many trials and errors, like experimenting with different colours, fonts, layouts and images to achieve what would feel the best to my viewers. Despite that, I still feel that I might not please others, so I had to view many websites as inspirations. Furthermore, I had to inspire myself from YouTube too. I targeted mostly #id instead of class so as not to change all at once. I still do not understand JavaScript and CSS fully, but I can sort them out by trial and error.
